# 0x01-Variables, If, Else, While

## Overview
   This project contains various scripts and C programs that test the definition, declaration and use of variables, the use of the if and if-else conditional statements as well as the while loop.

## Files

### 0-positive_or_negative.c
 A program that will assign a random number to `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive, negative or zero.

### 1-last_digit.c
 A program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable, as well as whether:
   - the last digit is greater than 5
   - the last digit is 0
   - the last digit is less than six and not 0

### 2-print_alphabet.c
 A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, using the `putchar` function only twice in the code.

### 3-print_alphabets.c
 A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase, while using the `putchar` function a maximum of three times.

### 4-print_alphabt.c
 A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except the letters `q` and `e` while only using the `putchar` function a maximum of twice in the code.

### 5-print_numbers.c
 A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

### 6-print_numberz.c
 A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 while only using the `putchar` function a maximum of twice in the code. Declaring variables of type `char` was prohibited.

### 7-print_tebahpla.c
 A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, while only using the `putchar` function twice in the code.

### 8-print_base16.c
 A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, while using the `putchar` function three times in the code.

### 9-print_comb.c
 A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
   - the numbers ought to be printed in ascending order while separated by a `,` followed by a space.
   - the `putchar` function was to be used a maximum of four times in the code.
   - Use of any variable of type char was prohibited.

### 100-print_comb3.c
 A program that prints all possible combinations of two digits.
   - The two digits had to be different
   - Combinations of two digits had to be different, while only the smallest combinations could be printed.
   - The `putchar` function could be used a maximum of five times while variables of type `char`  could not be used.
