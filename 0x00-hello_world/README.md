 6-size.c: A program that prints the size of various data types on a 32 bit and 64 bit machine.

 100-intel: A script that generates the assembly code (intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

 101-quote.c: A C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19` to the standard error.
